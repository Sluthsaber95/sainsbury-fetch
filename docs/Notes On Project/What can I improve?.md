# What can I improve?.md

`We appreciate your free time is important. Therefore, if you feel your unfinished code demonstrates enough for us to assess the application please leave some notes in your README.md explaining what you would do next given more time.`

There is a lot to improvement that can be made here, however I've narrowed it down to tooling I really wanted to use. 

The reason being was that I decided to go down the wise route, by not using newer technology or ones I don't have that much experience with. This left me more spare time to polish the project.

## Tooling
### GatsyJS
Gatsy static site framework and starter pack built on top of ReactJS. The reason I haven't used this is lack of experience, thus it would have taken longer to deliver the project
  - **Optimised Plugins**
    - loading of images faster & better UX with loading on blur
    - asset size and management depending on device size during fetching of assets
  - **Client Side GraphQL** - Data collection, retreival and organisation would be better managed. Data collection can be done from one source from GraphQL api - i.e. only from one endpoint

### StorybookJS
Really ashamed I didn't to invest enough time to play around by creating my "StorybookJS Playbooks"
  - **Easier to Understand Every Component** - let me explain, playbook is a catalogue you build for all your components
    - **Component Search Tool** - It enables each team member to search for the components they want
    - **Test out Components** - via different viewports, jest
    - **Isolated UI IDE** - build component UI here first

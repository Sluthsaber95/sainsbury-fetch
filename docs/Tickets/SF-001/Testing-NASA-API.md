# Testing NASA API

## Tasks - 1) Initial Testing of API
- Collate the data for 1 endpoint
- Display the data directly below search
- Make sure the right data is displayed for the image, 

## Tasks - 2) Search Error Testing of API
- Enter a muddled string into the search and expect no results to show
- Create a Simple UI Hint to user that no results from search can be found

## Tasks - 3) Multiple Images from API can be displayed from Search
- Display 6 different images from search results (best not ramp up the number of images presented, as speed of load is not the current focus here)
